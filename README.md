# Hey there, I'm Alex 👋

I'm a developer and ML enthusiast based in **Toronto, Canada**. I believe in building technology that bridges the gaps between humans and computers.

### 🛠 What I'm currently working on
- **Music Transformer:** Experimenting with attention-based models and genetic algorithms to generate creative compositions.
- **Fraud Detection Model:** Currently competing in a financial ML competition to refine my data modeling skills.
- **Ascension SMP:** A server-side only Minecraft mod centered around seven orders of the natural world.
